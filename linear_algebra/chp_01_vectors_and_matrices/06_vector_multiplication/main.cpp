    *  --------------------
    *  The dot product between two n-dimensional vectors a and b is a scalar quantity.
    *  The corresponding components of the two vectors are multiplied together and
    *  summed. This product gets its name from the notation a Â· b in which a dot is placed
    *  between the two vectors participating in the product. Because it produces a scalar
    *  quantity, the dot product is also known as the scalar product.

    *  constrained by the two vectors a and b.
