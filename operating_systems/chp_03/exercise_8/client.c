/*
*  An echo server echoes back whatever it receives from a client. For example, if a client sends
*  the server the string Hello there!, the server will respond with Hello there!
*  
*  Write an echo server using the Java networking API described in Section Sockets. This server
*  will wait for a client connection using the accept() method. When a client connection is received, the server will loop, performing the following steps:
*  
*  * Read data from the socket into a buffer.
*  * Write the contents of the buffer back to the client.
*  
*  The server will break out of the loop only when it has determined that the client has closed the connection.
*  
*  The date server of Figure 3.9.2 uses the java.io.BufferedReader class. BufferedReader extends the java.io.Reader
*  class, which is used for reading character streams. However, the echo server cannot guarantee that it will read
*  characters from clients; it may receive binary data as well. The class java.io.InputStream deals with data at the
*  byte level rather than the character level. Thus, your echo server must use an object that extends java.io.InputStream.
*  The read() method in the java.io.InputStream class returns âˆ’1 when the client has closed its end of the socket connection.
