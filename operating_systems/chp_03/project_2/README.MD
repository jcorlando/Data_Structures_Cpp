# Project 2 â€” Linux kernel module for task information

In this project, I will write a Linux kernel module that uses the /proc file system for displaying a task's information based on its process identifier value pid. This project will involve writing a process identifier to the file /proc/pid. Once a pid has been written to the /proc file, subsequent reads from /proc/pid will report (1) the command the task is running, (2) the value of the task's pid, and (3) the current state of the task.
