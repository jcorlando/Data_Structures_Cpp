# Project 1 â€” UNIX shell

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. The implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. This project involves using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and will be implemented on my home Linux system.
