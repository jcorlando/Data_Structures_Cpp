/*
*  Assignment : #2
*  Write a C program called time.c that determines the amount of time necessary
*  to run a command from the command line. This program will be run as "./time <command>"
*  and will report the amount of elapsed time to run the specified command. This will involve
*  using fork() and exec() functions, as well as the gettimeofday() function to determine
*  the elapsed time. It will also require the use of two different IPC mechanisms.
