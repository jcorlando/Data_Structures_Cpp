/*
*  The section on -- Communication in client-server systems - Sockets -- describes certain port
*  numbers as being well knownâ€”that is, they provide standard services. Port 17 is known as the
*  quote-of-the-day service. When a client connects to port 17 on a server, the server responds
*  with a quote for that day.
*  
*  Modify the date server shown in Figure 3.9.2 so that it delivers a quote of the day rather
*  than the current date. The quotes should be printable ASCII characters and should contain
*  fewer than 512 characters, although multiple lines are allowed. Since these well-known
*  ports are reserved and therefore unavailable, have your server listen to port 6017. The
*  date client shown in Figure 3.9.3 can be used to read the quotes returned by your server.
